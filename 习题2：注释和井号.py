# A comment,this is so you can read program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by Python.

print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print("This won't run")

print("This will run")

# 这里应该有一些拓展
# 如对于代码块应该如何进行注释:
# 三个单引号或者三个双引号
